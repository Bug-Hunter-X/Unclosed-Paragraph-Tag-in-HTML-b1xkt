This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in HTML: an unclosed tag.  The `bug.html` file contains an unclosed `<p>` tag, which can lead to unexpected rendering behavior in browsers.  The `solution.html` file shows the corrected code with the properly closed tag. This simple example highlights the importance of carefully checking for correct tag closure when writing HTML to ensure consistent and predictable rendering across different browsers and devices.
